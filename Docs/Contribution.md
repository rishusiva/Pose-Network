# How to Contribute?
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Once you figure out what to contribute, open an issue at <a href = "https://github.com/rishusiva/Pose-Network/issues">Issues</a>. Make sure that the issue is detailed with respect to your contribution.

2. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.

3. If you've added code that should be tested, run the tests.

4. Add **Proper Documentation**. Docstring should be added to the added/modified `.py` files. If you're adding a new class to be initialized, please mention the initialization to the `README.md` within the directory.

5. Once everything is done, create a **Pull Request**. Wait for review to resolve any problems, and merging.
